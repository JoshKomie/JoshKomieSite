I'd like to improve my procedural generation and rust skills so I'll be attempting to make a neat little map generator in rust. While it won't necessarily be a game (at least not yet) I'll be using the Bevy game engine for rendering, input, ui etc.

### Goals of the Project:
- Gain a better understanding of procedural generation specifically for 2D map generation
- Learn about and implement various map generation methods and techniques
- Create a Map Generator that can spit out 2D maps based on a seed
- Create some basic UI so users can tweak parameters and see how it affects the final result.
- Improve my writing skills through this blog.

You may notice the goals are a bit nebulous. That's because I don't have this super planned out. We'll just have to see how it goes!

Stay tuned for Part 1!
