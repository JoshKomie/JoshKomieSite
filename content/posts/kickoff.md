Welcome! I'd like to explore various game dev techniques and concepts, and document that process here. Some of the topics I plan to cover are:

- pathfinding
- procedural generation
- simulation techniques
- graphics and shaders
- quad trees and spatial partitioning
- more

Additionally, I'm going to start off using rust and I'd like to improve my usage of that language. I've explored several game engines and rendering libraries including bevy, winit and wpgu. Each has their pros and cons, but I've landed on the crate macroquad due to it's extreme simplicity and easyness and getting up and running. I may explore other crates for this in the future.
